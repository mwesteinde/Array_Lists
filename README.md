**Exercise 4 / CPEN 221 / Fall 2019**
# Documents from the WWW

In this exercise, the goal is to:

1. read a text document given its URL;
2. count the number of words in the document;
3. find the word that occurs most frequently in the document;
4. find the number of times the most frequent word appears in the document;
5. and compute an `int` that represents that `hashcode` for the document.

In this exercise, we create a `Document` datatype that is created using a URL and then supports the four key operations: `wordCount()`, `getFrequentWord()`, `getFrequentWordCount()` and `hashCode()`.
